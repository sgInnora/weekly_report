## Overview

This directory contains proof-of-concept (PoC) code and technical documentation for CVE-2025-4372, a use-after-free vulnerability in the WebAudio component of Google Chrome. These PoCs were developed by the Innora.ai Security Team for educational and vulnerability verification purposes.

## PoC Versions

We have included three different versions of the PoC, each with different capabilities:

### 1. [Basic Detection PoC](index.html)
A simple implementation that attempts to detect if the browser is vulnerable to CVE-2025-4372 by monitoring for memory corruption patterns.

### 2. [Advanced Detection PoC](advanced_poc.html)
A more sophisticated detection mechanism with detailed memory analysis, statistics tracking, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

### 3. [Exploit Demonstration PoC](exploit_poc.html)
Demonstrates how the vulnerability could be exploited to execute code by attempting to launch the calculator application (for verification purposes only).

## Technical Documentation

- [Technical Analysis](TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md) - Detailed technical analysis of the vulnerability mechanism
- [Original README](README.md) - Original documentation outlining the usage and expected results

## Usage Instructions

The included [serve.py](serve.py) script provides an easy way to test these PoCs locally:

```bash
# Run the server
./serve.py

# Or specify a particular PoC to run
./serve.py --version basic    # For basic detection
./serve.py --version advanced # For advanced detection
./serve.py --version exploit  # For exploit demonstration
```

## Disclaimer

These proof-of-concept examples are provided for **educational and security research purposes only**. They demonstrate the technical mechanism of the vulnerability without causing any harm or enabling malicious activity. The exploit demonstration is designed to simply verify exploitation potential through a harmless calculator launch, rather than performing any malicious actions.

The Innora.ai Security Team advocates for responsible disclosure and security research that improves the overall security of widely-used software like web browsers.

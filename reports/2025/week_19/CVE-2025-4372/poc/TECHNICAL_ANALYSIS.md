# Technical Analysis of CVE-2025-4372

## Overview

CVE-2025-4372 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the WebAudio component of Google Chrome. This vulnerability affects Chrome versions prior to 136.0.7103.92 and was patched in May 2025. The vulnerability was discovered by Huang Xilin of Ant Group Light-Year Security Lab.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Vulnerability

The vulnerability is a classic use-after-free (UAF) issue in the MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode component of Chrome's WebAudio implementation. Based on analysis of similar previous WebAudio vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-13720), the root cause is likely related to improper synchronization between the main JavaScript thread and the audio processing thread.

### Technical Details

1. **Multi-Threading Problem**: 
   The WebAudio API utilizes multiple threads for performance reasons:
   - Main thread: Handles JavaScript execution and WebAudio node creation/connection
   - Audio rendering thread: Processes audio data in real-time

2. **Lock Mechanism Failure**:
   The vulnerability likely stems from inadequate mutex protection when accessing shared objects between these threads. The MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode object appears to be accessible after being freed in specific race conditions.

3. **Race Condition Scenario**:
   - The MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode is created on the main thread
   - When connected to an audio graph, it's processed by the audio thread
   - Under certain conditions, when disconnecting and manipulating the node's stream (especially stopping audio tracks)
   - If garbage collection occurs at a specific time, the node might be freed while the audio thread still has a reference to it
   - This leads to a use-after-free condition where the audio thread accesses freed memory

## Attack Vector

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious webpage that:

1. Creates an AudioContext and associated audio nodes
2. Sets up a race condition by rapidly connecting/disconnecting nodes
3. Manipulates MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode's stream in a specific way 
4. Forces garbage collection at opportune moments
5. Uses heap spraying techniques to increase exploitation reliability
6. Potentially achieves arbitrary code execution through heap corruption

## Memory Model and Exploitation Path

The WebAudio vulnerability likely follows this exploitation path:

1. **Memory Layout**: 
   - The MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode object is allocated in Chrome's Blink heap
   - It contains references to MediaStream objects and audio processing components

2. **Vulnerability Trigger**:
   ```javascript
   // Create audio context and nodes
   const audioContext = new AudioContext();
   const destination = audioContext.createMediaStreamDestination();
   const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
   
   // Connect nodes
   oscillator.connect(destination);
   oscillator.start();
   
   // Create race condition
   setTimeout(() => {
     // Disconnect might free the destination node in certain conditions
     oscillator.disconnect();
     
     // But we still access it through its stream
     const track = destination.stream.getAudioTracks()[0];
     track.stop(); // This access might happen after freeing
   }, 0);
   ```

3. **Memory Corruption**:
   - When the MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode is freed, its memory area becomes available for reuse
   - If the audio thread still accesses this freed memory while it's being repurposed, memory corruption occurs
   - The exact corruption pattern depends on what new objects are allocated in the freed space

4. **Exploitation Technique**:
   - Heap spraying is used to place controlled data where the freed object was
   - When the audio thread accesses this memory, it operates on attacker-controlled data
   - This can lead to arbitrary read/write capabilities, potentially leading to code execution

## Proof of Concept Strategy

Our PoC takes the following approach:

1. **Create Race Conditions**:
   - Rapidly create, connect, and disconnect audio nodes
   - Use setTimeout with 0ms delay to yield to the event loop
   - Use a Web Worker to create parallel execution contexts

2. **Force Memory Pressure**:
   - Create many nodes to increase the chance of reusing freed memory
   - Limit references to allow garbage collection

3. **Detection Mechanism**:
   - Spray the heap with TypedArrays containing known patterns
   - Check for unexpected modifications to these patterns, which would indicate memory corruption
   - This non-intrusive approach allows detection without actively exploiting the vulnerability

## Mitigation

Google fixed this vulnerability by:

1. Implementing proper synchronization between threads accessing the MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode
2. Adding additional safeguards around how MediaStream objects and their tracks are accessed
3. Improving garbage collection handling for WebAudio nodes

## Similar Vulnerabilities

This vulnerability is similar to previous WebAudio vulnerabilities in Chrome:

1. **CVE-2019-13720**: A use-after-free in WebAudio that was exploited in the wild
2. **CVE-2021-30522**: Another use-after-free in WebAudio fixed in 2021
3. **CVE-2023-1222**: A heap buffer overflow in Web Audio API

These recurring issues highlight the complexity of properly handling multi-threaded access to shared memory in browsers, especially in performance-critical components like audio processing.
